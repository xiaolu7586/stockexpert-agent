## 🔧 Platform Capabilities Required

The following platform-level features exist in EasyClaw but are not yet implemented in ClawDI. Implementing them will significantly improve this agent's output quality.

| Capability | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Skill scanning mandate** | Forces the agent to fully load SKILL.md and all reference files before every reply — required for structured trading-coach output (tables, star ratings, 10-dimension insights) |
| **Reply formatting rules** | Injects output structure directives (section headers, tables, file-send via `MEDIA:`, silent mode via `NO_REPLY`) — the primary reason EasyClaw produces richer reports than plain text |
| **Workspace file auto-load** | Automatically injects SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, USER.md into session context at startup |
| **Runtime metadata injection** | Provides current datetime/timezone, model name, OS, and channel type (webchat/API/etc.) to the agent each session |
| **Safety rules** | Injects human-oversight and no-self-preservation constraints at the platform level |
